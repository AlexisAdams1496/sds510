I needed help with AI in figuring out the number needed to filter for in CIK was '1001871'. When I went into https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/standard-industrial-classification-sic-code-list, I could not find a number that matched any of the numbers in the log. Specifically, I found '8200	Office of Trade & Services	SERVICES-EDUCATIONAL SERVICES' and when I typed in 8200, I used all the numbers that popped up and none were working.
